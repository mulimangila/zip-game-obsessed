# Quick Number Finder Game – **When Life Gives You Lemons...**

It all started with a big idea: I wanted to create a game inspired by the LinkedIn Zip game. The goal? Something interactive, exciting, and a bit of a brain teaser. But, like many ideas, things didn’t go as planned. The Zip game concept didn’t take off as I had imagined. 😅

But instead of letting that idea sour, I thought: **When life gives you lemons, make a number-finding game!** 

### Enter the **Quick Number Finder Game**:  find numbers in order—from 1 to 36—**as fast as you can**! 

### How it Works (aka the Lemonade Recipe):

**Start with the Numbers**: When you hit *Start New Game*, you get a randomized grid of numbers from 1 to 36. Your mission? Find them in order. It sounds simple, right? Well, here’s the catch: **You have only 60 seconds** to find all the numbers—so you need to be quick! 

### The Big Picture:
What started as an idea for the Zip game turned into something even more exciting. **Every second counts** in this fast-paced number-finding challenge. It’s like life: things don’t always go as planned, but with a little pivot, you can end up with something fun and exciting.

So, when life hands you lemons, **click away, race against the clock, and find those numbers!** 🍋⏰
